# [React Pathfinding Visualizer](https://chrisliang12.github.io/pathfinding-visualizer-react/)

## Introduction
This is my very first React project. The idea is inspired by [Cl√©ment Mihailescu](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer).

This website visualizes several pathfinding algorithms, including BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Best First, and A*. Users can learn the search pattern of different algorithms by visualizing them in different mazes. The website also provides the features such as maze customization, speed control, etc.

## Link

## Heuristics
For now, the visualizer only supports two types of heuristics, the Manhatten distance, and Euclidean distance. Since the grid only allows 4 directions of movement, the Manhatten distance is preferred. 

For more details about heuristics, please look at this [website](http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/Heuristics.html).
