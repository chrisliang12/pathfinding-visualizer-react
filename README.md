# React Pathfinding Visualizer

## Introduction
This is my very first React project. The idea is inspired by [Clément Mihailescu](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer).

This website visualizes several pathfinding algorithms, including BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Best First, and A*. Users can learn the search pattern of different algorithms by visualizing them in different mazes. The website also provides the features such as maze customization, speed control, etc.
